# LearningCompose
 
## Implementing a Compose App with Dogs Api

Main objective of this project is to learn.

Feel free to send me any feedback even via dm on twitter @FelgueirasSimao

### General Highlights

* Coroutines with Flow
* StateFlow and Shared Flow (no Live data)
* Hilt for DI
* Compose
* Compose Navigation

### Architecture Highlights 

* MVVM on Ui Layer
* Unidirection Data Flow
* CA on Data Layer
* Single Activity

### Future Wishes:

* Offline Mode with Room
* High Testing Coverage (without doing TDD)
* Try Pager 3

## Things that are making me think

* Do we need fragments? Nope
* Where to place the viewmodel?
* Does the viewModel go as function parameter in a composable function?

* Do we need ViewModels inside a Compose world? I am thinking that might not. Lets see where it goes
